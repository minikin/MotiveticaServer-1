## Local Development

* Make sure you have at least Node 4.3. ```bash node -v```
* Clone this repo and change directory to it.```bash npm i```
* Install mongo locally using http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ or `brew install mongodb`
* Run ```bash mongo ``` to connect to your database, just to make sure it's working. Once you see a mongo prompt, exit with Control-D
* Run the server with: ```bash  npm start ```
* By default it will use a path of `/parse` for the API routes.
* You now have a database named that contains your Parse data
